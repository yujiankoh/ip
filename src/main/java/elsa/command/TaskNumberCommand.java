/**
 * A command that names one task by the number shown in the list, such as
 * "mark 2" or "delete 3".
 *
 * <p>Three commands work this way and all need the same check, so the check is
 * written here once and inherited. The number is kept exactly as the user typed
 * it, counting from 1, and turned into a list position only when the command
 * runs.
 *
 * <p>That split is deliberate. Whether "2" is a whole number can be settled while
 * reading the line, but whether a task 2 exists depends on how many tasks there
 * are, which the parser has no way of knowing. So the parser checks the writing
 * and this class checks the meaning, at the moment the list is in front of it.
