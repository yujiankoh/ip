/**

 * <p>A date has three different forms, and keeping them apart is the point of
 * this class:
 * <ul>
 * <li>what the user types: any of the forms in {@link #INPUT_FORMATS};</li>
 * <li>what the chatbot shows, and what the data file stores: Oct 15 2019 and
 *     2019-10-15 respectively, each written one way only;</li>
 * <li>what the task object holds: a {@link LocalDate}, which knows it is a date
 *     and can therefore be compared with another one.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Several forms are accepted on the way in, but a date is stored in one form
 * only, so a task typed as 15/10/2019 and one typed as 2019-10-15 are the same
 * task once read. Both the chatbot and {@link Storage} read dates through this
 * one class, so a date typed by the user and a date read back from the file
 * cannot disagree.
