description: Generate a self-contained, GitHub-style split-view HTML page that visually presents changes in the current Git repository. Use when asked to show, review, share, or inspect code changes visually; compare revisions, branches, commits, or the worktree; or create an HTML diff.

# Present Changes Visually

Generate one interactive HTML page containing every changed file as a side-by-side before/after diff. The page folds long unchanged runs, highlights changed words within modified lines, lets readers filter files, and includes collapsed panels for unchanged files.

## Generate the page

1. Treat the current repository as the target unless the user identifies another repository.
2. Use `HEAD` as the before point and `WORKTREE` as the after point unless the user specifies comparison points. `WORKTREE` includes staged, unstaged, and untracked (but not ignored) files.
3. Write to `_temp/visual-diff.html` unless the user supplies an output path. `_temp/` is gitignored, so generated pages are never committed.
4. Run the bundled generator from the repository root:

   ```bash
   python .claude/skills/present-changes-visually/scripts/generate-split-view-diff.py . HEAD WORKTREE _temp/visual-diff.html
   ```

   Replace `HEAD`, `WORKTREE`, and the output path with the requested values. The comparison points can be any Git commit-ish such as `HEAD~1`, a tag (`Level-2`), a branch, or a commit SHA. Use `WORKTREE` for the current files.

   This project is on Windows, where the launcher is `python` (or `py`); `python3` is not available. On macOS or Linux use `python3`.

5. Confirm the command succeeded and report the path to the generated page. Do not open a browser unless the user asks; the generator's `--open` flag does that when they do.

## Useful comparison points for this project

The increments are tagged, so tags make natural comparison points:

- Changes since the last commit: `HEAD WORKTREE`
- What one increment added: `Level-2 Level-3`
- Everything since the project started: `Level-0 WORKTREE`

## Verify output

Check that the page exists and that the generator's summary reports the expected changed-file count. For a visual review, open the generated HTML file in a browser when the user asks.

## Commit messages

When proposing or creating a commit message for the reviewed changes, follow this project's convention in `AGENTS.md`: an imperative subject line, plus a body explaining what changed and the rationale for it.

## Resource

`scripts/generate-split-view-diff.py` is the bundled generator. It uses only Python's standard library, so there is nothing to install. The page is self-contained except for the highlight.js syntax-highlighting script it loads from a CDN; without network access the page still works, just without coloured tokens.
