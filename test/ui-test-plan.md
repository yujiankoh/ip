# UI Test Plan

Text-based UI tests for the Elsa chatbot. Each test case below feeds a list of
commands to the program on standard input and compares the whole console output
against the expected output recorded here.

Run the tests with:

```
python .claude/skills/test-ui/scripts/run-ui-tests.py
```

## How the program is run

The runner builds the program once with Gradle, using this command:

```build
gradlew shadowJar
```

and then starts it once per test case with this command, both from the
repository root:

```run
java -jar build/libs/elsa.jar
```

The tests therefore run the same artifact the project ships. `java -jar` takes
no class name: it reads `Main-Class` from the jar's manifest, which Gradle
writes from the `mainClass` property in `build.gradle`. A wrong `mainClass`
compiles cleanly and so cannot be caught by compilation, but it fails every
case here immediately, which is the reason for testing the jar rather than the
compiled classes or the sources.

The build runs once, before the first case, so no case can test a stale jar.
The runner picks `gradlew.bat` on Windows and `./gradlew` elsewhere, so the
command written above stays the same on every platform.

The chatbot saves its tasks to `./data/elsa.txt` under the repository root and
reads them back at startup, so the runner puts that file into a known state
before every case:

- a case with a ```` ```data ```` block starts with exactly those lines saved;
- a case without one starts with no data file at all, as on a first ever run.

Cases are therefore independent of each other and of anything left behind by an
earlier run. Saving itself is still not checked directly, because it prints
nothing to the console; loading is, because what was loaded shows up in `list`.

## How outputs are compared

- The **whole** console output is compared, including the banner and greeting.
- Trailing whitespace on each line is ignored, as is any blank line at the very
  end of the output. This matters because the banner lines end in spaces that an
  editor may trim from this file.
- Everything else must match exactly, including leading indentation.

Because the greeting and the border style appear in every expected output,
changing either of them means updating every test case below. The runner prints
a line-by-line difference on failure, which shows exactly what to change.

## How to add a test case

Add a `###` heading, an `**Aim:**` line, an ` ```input ` block, and an
` ```expected ` block. Cases run top to bottom and the session stops at the
first failure.

A case may also carry an ` ```data ` block, placed before the input block. Its
lines are written to `./data/elsa.txt` before the program starts, which is how a
case sets up tasks that an earlier run is meant to have saved.

### TC-1 - Greet and exit immediately

**Aim:** Check that the chatbot greets the user on startup and exits on `bye`, with no tasks involved.

```input
bye
```

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
```

---

### TC-2 - List when nothing has been added

**Aim:** Check that `list` on an empty task list reports the empty-list message instead of printing an empty block.

```input
list
bye
```

```expected

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
```

---

### TC-3 - Reject an unknown command and an empty todo description

**Aim:** Check the two errors from the Level-5 examples are reported with the OLAF!!! prefix and say how to correct the input, and that rejecting an input leaves stored tasks untouched.

```input
todo borrow book
todo
blah
list
bye
```

```expected
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
      _____ _

     | |__ | / __|/ _` |
     |  __|| \__ \ (_| |
     |_____|_|___/\__,_|
     Hello! I'm Elsa.

     Got it. I've added this task:
       [T][ ] borrow book
     Now you have 1 task in the list.

     OLAF!!! The description of a todo cannot be empty. Use: todo <description>
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
     OLAF!!! I'm sorry, but I don't know what that means :-(
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
     Here are the tasks in your list:
     1.[T][ ] borrow book
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
```

### TC-4 - Mark a task as done

**Aim:** Check that `mark 2` reports the task it changed and that only that task shows `[X]` in a later `list`, confirming the 1-based number maps to the right task.

```input
todo read book
todo return book
mark 2
list
bye
```

```expected
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
      _____ _
     |  ___| |___  __ _
     | |__ | / __|/ _` |
     |  __|| \__ \ (_| |
     |_____|_|___/\__,_|
     Hello! I'm Elsa.

       [T][ ] return book
     Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
```

### TC-5 - Unmark a task that was marked done

**Aim:** Check that `unmark` reverses a previous `mark`, returning the task to `[ ]` rather than leaving it done or removing it.

```input
todo read book
mark 1
unmark 1
list
bye
```

```expected
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
      _____ _
     |  ___| |___  __ _
     | |__ | / __|/ _` |
     |  __|| \__ \ (_| |
     |_____|_|___/\__,_|

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
     OK, I've marked this task as not done yet:
       [T][ ] read book
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
     Here are the tasks in your list:
     1.[T][ ] read book
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

     The cold never bother me anyways!
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
```

### TC-6 - Add todos and list them

**Aim:** Check that `todo` adds a task marked `[T]`, confirms it with the running task count, and that the type marker survives being marked done.

```input
todo borrow book
todo read book
mark 2
list
bye
```

```expected
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

     | |__ | / __|/ _` |
     |  __|| \__ \ (_| |
     |_____|_|___/\__,_|

       [T][ ] read book
     Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
     Here are the tasks in your list:
     1.[T][ ] borrow book
     2.[T][X] read book
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
```

### TC-7 - Add a deadline with a date

**Aim:** Level-8 requires the text after `/by` to be understood as a date rather than kept as text, so this case checks both halves of that. A date typed as `2019-10-20` must be accepted and then shown in the reading format, `Oct 20 2019`, which is only possible if it was understood rather than copied. Text that is not a date must be refused with the form to use, where before Level-8 it would have been stored as it stood. The closing `list` shows the rejected line added nothing.

```input
todo borrow book
deadline return book /by 2019-10-20
deadline do homework /by no idea
list
bye
```

```expected
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

     Got it. I've added this task:

     Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
     OLAF!!! "no idea" is not a date. Write it as 2019-10-15, 15/10/2019 (day/month/year) or Oct 15 2019. Use: deadline <description> /by <date>
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

     The cold never bother me anyways!
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
```

### TC-8 - Add events and list all three task types together

**Aim:** Check that `event` splits the description, start date, and end date apart on `/from` and `/to`, displays the task as `[E]`, and that todos, deadlines, and events coexist in one list and can each be marked done.

```input
todo borrow book
deadline return book /by 2019-10-20
event project meeting /from 2019-10-21 /to 2019-10-22
mark 3
list
bye
```

```expected

### TC-9 - Reject empty deadline and event descriptions between valid adds

**Aim:** Check that each kind of task names itself in the error, with the correct article, and that a rejected add does not consume a slot or shift the numbering of the tasks after it.

```input
deadline
deadline return book /by 2019-10-20
event
event project meeting /from 2019-10-21 /to 2019-10-22

### TC-10 - Handle a blank line, surrounding spaces, and the wrong letter case

**Aim:** Check that an empty line is reported rather than silently ignored, that spaces around a command and its description are trimmed away, and that commands are case sensitive so `BYE` does not end the session.

```input

   todo   read book   
BYE
list
bye
```

### TC-11 - Reject task numbers that are missing, not numbers, or out of range

**Aim:** Check that each way of getting a task number wrong is reported differently rather than ending the session, and that a valid mark still works afterwards, showing the rejected commands changed nothing.

```input
mark 1
todo read book
mark abc
mark 99
mark 0
unmark
mark 1
list
bye
```

     Hello! I'm Elsa.
     Do you want to build a snowman?
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
     OLAF!!! There are no tasks yet, so there is nothing to mark. Add one with "todo <description>" first.
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
     Got it. I've added this task:
       [T][ ] read book
     Now you have 1 task in the list.
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
     OLAF!!! "abc" is not a task number. Use a whole number, for example: mark 2.
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
     OLAF!!! There is no task 99. You have 1 task, so use a number from 1 to 1.

    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

### TC-12 - Reject deadlines and events with missing or empty parts

### TC-13 - Reject events with a missing separator or an empty part

**Aim:** Check all four ways an event's arguments can be wrong are reported separately, mirroring the deadline coverage in TC-12, since event parsing splits twice and a fault in either split would otherwise go unnoticed. The valid add at the end confirms the four rejections left the list empty rather than half filled.

```input
event meeting /to 4pm
event /from Mon /to 4pm
event meeting /from /to 4pm
event meeting /from 2019-10-21 /to
event standup /from 2019-10-21 /to 2019-10-22
list
bye

### TC-14 - Delete a task from the middle of the list

**Aim:** Check that `delete` reports the task it removed and the remaining count, and that the tasks after it are renumbered. The `mark 3` afterwards targets the task that moved up into position 3, proving the renumbering applies to later commands and is not just how `list` happens to print.

```input
todo read book
deadline return book /by 2019-06-06
event project meeting /from 2019-08-06 /to 2019-08-07
todo join sports club
delete 3
mark 3
list
bye
```

### TC-15 - Reject bad delete numbers, then delete the last task

**Aim:** Check that `delete` rejects a missing, non-numeric and out-of-range number the same way `mark` does, that the rejections leave the task in place, and that deleting the only task empties the list rather than leaving a stale entry behind.

```input
delete 1
todo read book
delete abc
delete 99
delete
delete 1
list

### TC-16 - Change the list in every way that triggers a save

**Aim:** Saving to `./data/elsa.txt` happens whenever the task list changes, and it must be invisible from the console: it may not print anything of its own, and it may not stop a command from finishing. This case runs every command that changes the list -- the three adds, `mark`, `unmark` and `delete` -- so a save that printed a stray line, or failed and turned a confirmation into an `OLAF!!!` error, would show up as a difference here. The closing `list` confirms the six changes left the task list in the state the saved file should mirror.

```input
todo read book
deadline return book /by 2019-06-06
event project meeting /from 2019-08-06 /to 2019-08-07
mark 1
unmark 1

### TC-17 - Start with tasks saved by an earlier run

**Aim:** Level-7 requires the tasks to be read back from the hard disk at startup. This case starts with a data file holding one of each kind of task, so `list` must show all three with the descriptions, dates and done markers they were saved with, rather than the empty-list message. The `delete 2` and `unmark 1` afterwards check that loaded tasks are ordinary members of the list: they can be numbered, changed and removed exactly like tasks typed in this session.

```data
T | 1 | read book
D | 0 | return book | 2019-06-06
E | 0 | project meeting | 2019-08-06 | 2019-08-07
```

```input
list
delete 2
unmark 1
list

### TC-18 - Keep the good tasks when some lines cannot be understood

**Aim:** A hand-edited data file can go wrong in several ways at once, and one bad line must not cost the user the tasks on every other line. This file has a done marker that is neither 1 nor 0, a deadline with no due time, an unknown type letter, and a blank line. The three faulty lines must each be reported with their line number and what is wrong, the blank line must pass without comment, and the two sound tasks must load and be usable. The warning has to say that saving rewrites the file, because the `todo` at the end does exactly that and the skipped lines are then gone.

```data
T | 1 | read book
T | 7 | bad marker
D | 0 | return book

X | 0 | mystery
T | 0 | buy milk
```

```input
list
todo water plants
bye
```

### TC-19 - Refuse text that would break the saved file apart

**Aim:** Tasks are stored with their fields separated by a bar with a space on each side, so a description or a time containing that text would be read back as extra fields and the task would return changed or not at all. The chatbot must refuse it when it is typed, where the user can still fix it, rather than accepting it and losing part of the task at the next startup. Every part the user supplies is checked, not only descriptions, so a time is tried here too. The valid `todo` at the end shows the four rejections changed nothing.

```input
todo a | b
deadline a | b /by 2019-10-20
deadline return book /by Sun | day
event project meeting /from 2pm | 3pm /to 4pm
todo read book
list

### TC-20 - Separate a command from its argument with a tab

**Aim:** A user who types or pastes a tab instead of a space has still named a command and given it an argument, so the chatbot should read it the same way rather than rejecting the whole line as an unknown command. Note for anyone editing this file: the two input lines below contain real tab characters, and replacing them with spaces would leave the case passing without testing anything.

```input
todo	read book
mark	1
list
bye

### TC-21 - Reject dates in the data file that are not dates

**Aim:** The data file stores dates in the same form the user types them, so a file written before Level-8, or edited by hand, can hold text where a date belongs. Line 2 holds the free text a pre-Level-8 file would contain, and line 3 holds a date that is written correctly but does not exist, since February has no 30th. Both must be reported with the same wording the chatbot uses when the text is typed, and the sound lines above and below them must still load, so that one outdated line does not cost the user the rest of the file.

```data
D | 1 | return book | 2019-06-06
D | 0 | old style | June 6th
D | 0 | impossible | 2019-02-30
E | 0 | project meeting | 2019-08-06 | 2019-08-07

### TC-22 - Accept a date written in any of the accepted forms

**Aim:** A date may be typed in several forms, and all of them have to mean the same day once read. The first three lines write 15 October 2019 three different ways, including one in lower case, and each must come back as the single reading form `Oct 15 2019`, which can only happen if each was understood rather than copied. The fourth line is the example from the Level-8 statement: `2/12/2019` must be 2 December, not 12 February, so the day is read before the month. The last line asks for a day February does not have; it must be refused rather than quietly moved to the 28th, since a date silently changed is worse than one rejected. The closing `list` shows the four accepted dates side by side and the rejected one absent.

```input
deadline year first /by 2019-10-15
deadline slashes /by 15/10/2019
deadline month name /by oct 15 2019
deadline day before month /by 2/12/2019
deadline no such day /by 31/2/2019

### TC-23 - List the tasks falling on one date

**Aim:** `on` answers a different question from `list`, and each kind of task answers it differently: a deadline falls on the one day it is due, an event on every day it runs including its first and last, and a todo on no day at all. The three queries here check all of that: Oct 15 finds the deadline and the running event, Oct 14 and Oct 16 find the event on its boundary days, where an exclusive comparison would wrongly leave it out, and Oct 20 finds nothing and must say so rather than print an empty heading. The todo never appears. The numbers shown are the ones the tasks have in the full list, 2 and 3 rather than 1 and 2, so that a number read here can be given straight to `mark` or `delete`; renumbering from 1 would make those commands act on the wrong task. The last two lines check that a missing date and an unreadable one are each reported.

```input
todo borrow book
deadline return book /by 2019-10-15
event conference /from 2019-10-14 /to 2019-10-16
on 2019-10-15

### TC-24 - Mark a deadline overdue only when it is still owed

**Aim:** A deadline whose date has passed and which is not done is overdue, and nothing else is. The four tasks here cover each way that can go: a past deadline carries the note, a future one does not, a past one that has been marked done loses the note the moment it is marked, and an event never carries it whatever its dates, since an event that has finished is not a debt. Note the dates chosen: 2019 is in the past and 2999 in the future whenever these tests are run, so a case that depends on today's date still gives the same output every day. A date near today would make this case start failing on its own.

```input
deadline past deadline /by 2019-10-15
deadline future deadline /by 2999-01-01
deadline finished deadline /by 2019-10-15
mark 3
event past event /from 2019-10-14 /to 2019-10-16

### TC-25 - Find tasks by a keyword in the description

**Aim:** Check that `find` shows every task whose description contains the keyword and leaves out the ones that do not, and that each task keeps the number it has in the full list rather than being renumbered from 1. Keeping the number is what lets a number read here be given straight to `mark` or `delete`. One matching task is marked done first, so the result is shown to carry the task's real state rather than a fresh copy.

```input
todo read book
deadline return book /by 2999-06-06
todo buy milk
mark 1
find book
bye
```

### TC-26 - Find ignoring the case of the keyword

**Aim:** Check that the search ignores case, so a task written in capitals is found by a keyword typed in lower case. Someone looking for a task they wrote themselves should not have to remember how they capitalised it. The matching task is the second one, so this also shows a result numbered 2 rather than renumbered to 1.

```input
todo read book
todo buy MILK
find milk

### TC-27 - Reject a find with nothing to look for, and report finding nothing

**Aim:** Check the two ways `find` produces no list: a keyword that matches nothing is reported as such rather than as an empty list, and a `find` with no keyword at all is refused with the usage, as every other command with a missing argument is. The two are told apart so the user knows whether they mistyped the keyword or forgot it.

```input
todo read book
find zebra
find
bye
```

```expected
    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

### TC-28 - List the commands with help

**Aim:** Check that `help` names every command the chatbot understands, and says how a date may be written. This is what the window's greeting sends a new user to, so a command missing here is one nobody is told about. Running `help` before and after adding a task also shows it reads rather than changes: the task list is the same afterwards, and the answer does not depend on what is in it.

```input
help
todo read book
list
bye
```

```expected
